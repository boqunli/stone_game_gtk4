# stone_game_gtk4

Two players take stones from the stone heap in turns.
The one who takes the last stone loses the game.

### Usage

#### Windows MSYS2 MinGW-w64

[The GTK Project - A free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows/)

- Install GTK4

  ```bash
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject
  ```

- Compile by command

  ```bash
  gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk4` main_window.c -o main `pkg-config --libs gtk4`
  ```

### Known Issue

The given `settings.glade` is the XML UI file generated by Glade 3. However, `glade` does NOT support GTK 4, so is not applicable. Instead, use manually-written `settings.ui` for GTK Builder.
